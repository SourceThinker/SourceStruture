# SourceStruture
When I learned the java open source,I always feel lost  in the sea of code.So I decide to start this project to  view the source struture for the new programmer.I hope to support Maven project on the first version. UML maybe standard and supported by many company  ,but it isn't suited for the beginers and  diagrams are not recognised by them.In the future,I maybe support the UML.
